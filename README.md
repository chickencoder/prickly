# Prickly :cactus:

Prickly is a small implementation of a forth-inspired stack-based language. My intention is to use it as a live coding environment for algorithmic arpeggiator music.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/chickencoder/prickly
cd prickly
python prickly.py
```

Running the python script will open up a REPL in your terminal.

## Features
The language currently implements the following word operators...
* negate
* abs
* max
* min
* dup
* swap
* rot
* drop
* wipe

The language implementation is very similar to [this guide](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/forth/) to forth. The same rules apply up until compile-only word definitions etc. which are still to
be implemented.
